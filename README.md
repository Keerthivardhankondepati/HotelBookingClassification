# HotelBookingClassification
Worked on this project in Coursework in my Graduate program.
Usually, Hotel bookings are prone to cancellations due to various reasons. When a booking is cancelled, the room goes unoccupied, and this will directly impact the revenue of the hotel. Also, with the existing rate of cancellations, client is experiencing a serious loss in the revenue and are planning to implement cost cutting measures to reduce the overhead expenses.
Below are the cost cutting measures:
To stop giving welcome drinks
Make customers pay for one breakfast which usually covers under complementary benefits.
To reduce the quality of toiletries that are provided to the customers during their stay
To reduce the amount in the bonus check to the hotel employees 
All the above measure will impact the customer’s experience and might reduce the chance of rebooking a room with the same hotel. Also, reducing the bonus might create a backlash between the employees and management. As a result, to avoid the problems and possible reactions it is required to predict the cancellation probability and manage the booking.
The hotel’s financial predicament can be mitigated by identifying the patterns from the past bookings and later use them in predicting the cancellation probability of a future booking. Once, if a booking is identified as a problematic booking, this can be addressed by the management to take necessary actions for avoiding loss in the revenue based on the customer’s traits and preferences.
The hotel’s revenue will be improved significantly without implementing cost-cutting measures, post-implementation of the solution.
